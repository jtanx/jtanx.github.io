# My blog

So I've gotten on the blogging bandwagon as well. Since I'm no web designer, this style is a straight clone of [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde).

Diagrams are (mostly) done in [draw.io](https://draw.io).

## Running locally

If it doesn't change (yet again):

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
